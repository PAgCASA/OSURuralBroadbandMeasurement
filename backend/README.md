## Development Flow

Go in to the `backend/cmd/server` directory then run `go test .` to run all tests. Then fix the application code so all the tests pass!

We use Fiber to handle the web requests. Documentation can be found at https://docs.gofiber.io/

Eventually we'll include prometheus to monitor the application and a few other bits and bobs, but for now we are keeping it simple
